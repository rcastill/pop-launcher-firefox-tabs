# Firefox Tabs Pop Launcher Plugin

**DISCLAIMER**: Work in Progress

Plugin that lists firefox tabs in [pop os launcher](https://github.com/pop-os/launcher).

## Requirements

Because of a limitation with [firefox-rs](https://github.com/rcastill/firefox-rs), at the moment of writing, you must install [focusTab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/focus_tab/) firefox extension.

## TODO

- [ ] Proper search implementation
- [ ] Favicon as item icon?
- [ ] Installation script
- [ ] Publish firefox-rs and this plugin
